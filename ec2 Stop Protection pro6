## Project Summary (Professional Way)

As part of an AWS cloud migration project, I worked on managing and securing EC2 resources. One of my key responsibilities was to **protect critical EC2 instances from accidental operational actions**.
I successfully enabled **Stop Protection** for an EC2 instance named `nautilus-ec2` in the **us-east-1** region to ensure service availability and prevent unintentional shutdowns.

This task helped improve **operational safety, availability, and governance** within the AWS environment.

## Interview Questions & Easy Professional Answers

### Q1. What is Stop Protection in EC2?

**Answer:**
Stop Protection is a feature in EC2 that prevents an instance from being accidentally stopped through the AWS Console, CLI, or API.

---

### Q2. Why did you enable Stop Protection for the instance?

**Answer:**
The instance was critical to the migration environment, and enabling Stop Protection ensured uninterrupted availability by avoiding accidental shutdowns.

---

### Q3. Does Stop Protection prevent termination?

**Answer:**
No. Stop Protection only prevents stopping the instance. Termination protection is a separate feature.

---

### Q4. Can Stop Protection be bypassed?

**Answer:**
Yes, but only after explicitly disabling Stop Protection. This adds an extra safety layer.

---

### Q5. In which scenarios is Stop Protection recommended?

**Answer:**
It is recommended for:

* Production servers
* Critical application instances
* Migration-related infrastructure
* Long-running workloads

---

### Q6. How does this task add value to a cloud project?

**Answer:**
It improves operational safety, reduces human error, and ensures high availability of critical resources.
